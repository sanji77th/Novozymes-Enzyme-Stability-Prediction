# Thermostability Prediction of Enzyme Variants

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the thermostability of enzyme variants using a linear regression model. The goal is to understand how mutations affect the melting temperature (Tm) of enzymes, which is a critical factor in assessing their stability under high temperatures. By leveraging the dataset containing experimentally measured Tm values along with various data fields such as enzyme sequence, pH value, and data resource, we aim to develop a model that can accurately predict thermostability.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises a collection of enzyme variants, including both natural sequences and engineered variants with single or multiple mutations. Each variant is associated with experimentally measured Tm values. Additionally, the dataset includes relevant information such as the enzyme sequence, pH value, and data resource. The dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the prediction model.

## Approach
The project leverages a linear regression model to predict the thermostability of enzyme variants. Linear regression is a well-established technique that captures the linear relationship between independent variables (such as enzyme sequence and pH) and the dependent variable (Tm). By fitting the model to the dataset, we can estimate the coefficients of the variables and generate predictions for thermostability.

## Linear Regression Model
Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that aims to predict a continuous target variable (in this case, Tm) based on one or more independent variables. The model assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the target variable, allowing us to estimate the impact of each independent variable on the target variable. By using the linear regression model, we can make predictions on the thermostability of enzyme variants.

## Tools and Packages
In this project, we utilized the following tools and packages:
- Jupyter Notebook: Used as the development environment for data analysis, model training, and result visualization.
- scikit-learn (sklearn): A powerful machine learning library in Python, providing efficient implementations of various algorithms, including linear regression.
- NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing, enabling efficient numerical operations on arrays and matrices.
- pandas: A versatile data manipulation library used for data preprocessing, exploration, and transformation.
- seaborn and matplotlib: Data visualization libraries that assist in creating clear and informative graphs and plots.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we successfully developed a linear regression model to predict the thermostability of enzyme variants based on the provided dataset. By analyzing the impact of various factors such as enzyme sequence, pH value, and data resource, we gained insights into how these variables influence thermostability. The predictions obtained from the model can assist in understanding the stability of enzyme variants and guide future protein engineering efforts.
